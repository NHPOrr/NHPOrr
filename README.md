- 👋 Hi, I’m @NHPOrr
- 👀 I’m interested in soft matter, scattering and crystallography. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning MatLab and Python 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on crystal structure analysis methods (from particle coordinates) and small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis methods. 
- 📫 How to reach me: nicholasorrchem@gmail.com
